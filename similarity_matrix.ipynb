Furthermore, the Central Government said that two other vaccine candidates in India were at advanced stages of testing.\"The phase III trial of Covishield vaccine will begin at Sassoon hospital from next week. It is likely to start on Monday (21 September). Some volunteers have already come forward for the trial. Around 150 to 200 volunteers will be administered the vaccine candidate dose,\"\\xa0Muralidhar Tambe, the Dean of the state-run hospital, told news agency PTI.Phase II trials were conducted at\\xa0Bharti Vidyapeeth Medical College and also KEM Hospital in the city.The SII has partnered with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca for manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed by the University of Oxford.Apart from the Oxford candidate, two more vaccine candidates in India are in advanced stages of clinical trials, while four are in pre-clinical development stage, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha. There are a total of 30 vaccine candidates in India in various stages of development and testing.India’s first CRISPR COVID-19 test developed by Tata, CSIR-IGIB approved for useIndia’s first CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) COVID19 test, developed by the Tata Group and CSIR-IGIB, was approved for use in India, the Ministry of Science and Technology said on Saturday.According to\\xa0Hindustan Times,\\xa0Tata CRISPR test is as accurate as the traditional RT-PCR tests but takes\\xa0lesser time to process the results. The equipment are also less expensive.\"Tata CRISPR COVID-19 test uses an indigenously developed, cutting-edge CRISPR technology for detection of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" the report said.Over 190% rise in active Covid-19 cases in Delhi in a monthThe number of active COVID-19 cases in Delhi increased by around 190 percent in a month with 84,087 people contracting the disease during the period, according to government data.There were 11,068 active COVID-19 cases on 18 August. The number increased to a record 32,250 on Friday, an analysis of Delhi government\\'s health bulletins showed.A similar trend was witnessed in June, when the number of active COVID-19 cases rose from 11,555 on 1 June to 28,329 on 27 June. It, however, tapered off to 10,705 active cases by 31 July.On 4 August, it dropped below the 10,000-mark for the first time since 30 May and stood at 9,897, owing to a good recovery rate and less new cases.But just when it seemed the number might drop further, it started rising again with an increase in new cases.Parliament Monsoon Session likely to be curtailed due to COVID-19 spreadThe ongoing monsoon session of Parliament is likely to be curtailed and may end by the middle of next week in view of the threat of the COVID-19 spread among parliamentarians, official sources said on Saturday.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on 14 September and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.After some Members of Parliament, including Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel, tested positive for COVID-19 during the session, some opposition parties had conveyed to the government that conducting the full 18-day session could be a risky affair, sources told PTI.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Centre expresses concern over higher fatality rate in 12 statesExpressing concern over COVID-19 fatality rates in some states being higher than the national average, the Cabinet secretary on Saturday urged 12 states and UTs to analyse mortalities district and hospital-wise to identify critical areas of intervention. At a high-level review meet, the secretary also exhorted them to ensure optimal utilisation of RT-PCR testing capacity, while underlining the need for ensuring that no symptomatic negative case tested in rapid antigen examination is missed, and all such cases mandatorily undergo RT-PCR test, the Union Health Ministry said.During the meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary, the minister of commerce and industry addressed these states and UTs and reviewed the oxygen availability there.The 12 states and Union Territories that participated in the virtual meet included Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Chandigarh, Telangana, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal, the health ministry said.\"About 80 percent of the COVID-19 caseload in the country is concentrated in these states and UTs,\" it said.\"The Minister of Commerce and Industry specifically requested them to focus on analysing district-level and health facility-level status and effectively plan and manage logistical issues related to oxygen availability,\" the health ministry said.The country\\'s COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20 lakh on 7 August, while it exceeded 30 lakh cses on 23 August, 40 lakh on 5 September, and it went past 50 lakh on 16 September.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, a cumulative 6,24,54,254 COVID-19 samples have been tested up to 18 September — 8,81,911 of them on Friday.The total 85,619 deaths reported so far in the country include 1,791 from Maharashtra followed by 8,685 from Tamil Nadu, 7,808 from Karnataka, 5,244 from Andhra Pradesh.With inputs from PTI'"

These include 64 doctors, 32 auxiliary nurse midwives and multipurpose healthcare workers, 14 ASHA workers and 45 other frontline workers who lost their lives.He also noted that it would take a substantive amount of time for developing herd immunity to be able to cover about 70 per cent of the population. Hence the focus of the government is primarily towards putting together a strategy that combines containment and hospital management, the minister said.Being a doctor himself, Vardhan answered questions on the clinical management of COVID-19 in great detail dispelling myths surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and plasma therapy in treating coronavirus patients. He also explained to his audience how coronavirus becomes fatal for the elderly and those with comorbidity.He also sought to dispel fears caused by the suspension of trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, saying vaccine development is a complex process and trials have restarted only after an independent investigative expert committee permitted them to proceed.\"He explained the difference between various vaccines under clinical trial in India and that since formulations, doses, route of administration are different for the vaccines, their mechanisms of action are also different.\"However, the desirable outcome of each vaccine is much the same, that is ensuring healthy individuals with immunity against the novel coronavirus,\" the statement said.During the 'Sunday Samvad', he shared several tips for the mental wellbeing of senior citizens.About concrete measures planned to handle public health emergencies in the future, Vardhan said, the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' will strengthen the nation to an extent where \"we will be able to overcome any eventuality including another pandemic\".The health minister said 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' underlines the government's commitment towards increased investments in public health and other health reforms to prepare India for future pandemics.A major proposal under consideration at the Expenditure Finance Committee level includes strengthening surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response including that for points of entry, the establishment of dedicated infectious disease management hospital blocks in district hospitals and Integrated Public Health Laboratories, he added.Vardhan also spoke on the role of traditional medicine in the present context and informed those who attended the 'Samvad' event that the AYUSH Ministry has developed research protocols for validating claims of various Ayush practitioners for COVID-19 solutions although no formulation has been validated as a specific drug.Vardhan also answered queries regarding India's plan to divert human resources to science and the role of government policy in achieving a clean environment witnessed during the coronavirus-induced lockdown.\n",

The partial reopening is to facilitate the students to clear their doubts in any subject in their classrooms while following all the precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19,\" Gupta said.The school education department has worked out arrangements with the school management, which undertook fumigation and sanitisation and made available an adequate number of hand sanitisers and face masks to students.Meanwhile, the Punjab government has allowed students of classes 9 to 12 to visit their schools in areas outside containment zones on voluntary basis.However, this permission will be subject to written consent of parents/guardians from 21 September as per Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 8 September, the state government said in a statement.The state home department has issued detailed instructions to also permit skill or entrepreneurship training in National Skill Training Institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), short term training centres registered with the National Skill Development Corporation or State Skill Development Missions or other ministries of the Government of India or the state governments, the release said.Likewise, activities of National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD), Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) and their training providers have also been allowed from 21 September subject to strict adherence of the said SOPs, it added.On the other hand, states like Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand, West Bengal announced schools will not reopen this week.'30% of COVID patients from other states'Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday that said 30 percent of the COVID-19 patients admitted in city hospitals are from other states, and added that most of them have been occupying ICU beds at private facilities.Amid a rise in the number of non-resident patients, the Delhi government has decided to collect data of their deaths separately, he said, adding that the National Capital has the \"lowest death rate\" in the country.Based on data of the last 10 days, the death rate in Delhi stands at 0.77 percent. \"Around 30 percent COVID-19 patients admitted to Delhi hospitals are from outside the city,\" he told reporters.\"People coming in from outside prefer private hospitals.

That's why ICU beds are full there,\" he said.\"Most of them have occupied ICU beds in private hospitals. There are 1,500 such patients admitted to Delhi hospitals,\" he said.The minister, however, said there are around 1,000 ICU beds available in Delhi at present.

            "0.33906903862953186  ===>  By Govindraj EthirajMumbai: The total number of COVID-19 cases in India has now crossed the 5 million mark. In Mumbai, the number is now over 175,000 with over 8,200 deaths. The hospital beds in the city, particularly in intensive care units, seem to be under much greater pressure than they were until a few weeks ago. Why is this happening? How is the administration responding to this?Indiaspend spoke to Gautam Bhansali, a specialist in general medicine and infectious diseases at Bombay Hospital in south Mumbai. He is also the chief coordinator between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body, and the private hospitals in the city for managing the beds.Edited excerpts:Why is it that after a few months, we are suddenly seeing a sudden pressure on hospital beds, including intensive care units?We were in a much better position in July and August. In September, we have definitely seen a big surge in the number of cases. There are two or three reasons for it: One is that the lockdown has almost entirely been relaxed, and people are also coming from other places for treatment. Due to that, you could say, it is like a second wave--cases have increased in Mumbai. But we need to understand why the lockdown was enforced. It was to educate people, spread awareness as to what is to be done to fight COVID-19. It is a new disease, a new challenge and a new learning for everybody. Meanwhile, we needed to prepare health infrastructure. Our health infrastructure was not ready when this disease struck us, around March. We needed to create negative pressure in the ICUs and in the ward, set up different entry and exit points (for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients).Now that the number of cases has increased, we are totally geared up with enough beds. There was some shortage of beds in between. We closed down some nursing homes one month back because there were some issues there--complaints of overcharging and high mortality rate. Those issues have been almost sorted out.You are talking about those 73 nursing homes that were taken off COVID-19 duty. Of these, 27 have now been reopened. Is that correct?On 14 September, we had a meeting with the municipal commissioner and the chief minister--as the number of cases has increased, and we assume that the number is going to increase further. Plus, there is an influx of patients from other places too--from Sangli, Dhule, Kolhapur, Nasik, Pune, etc. Cases are coming to Mumbai from all over the state. People want to get treated in Mumbai because they feel Mumbai has better health infrastructure, best doctors, skilled health professionals and that they will get the best treatment. So, we opened the 27 nursing homes, which have more than 25 beds each. They are well regulated, have MD doctors (with advanced medical degrees) and critical care specialists.If you have 100 beds, for instance, how many are now occupied by people from outside Mumbai?About 30 percent to 40 percent of the people admitted in these hospitals--nursing homes and big private hospitals--are from outside the Mumbai metropolitan region--from Bhiwandi, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, etc.And what would that number be for pre-COVID times--for instance, at this time last year?People come to Mumbai for treatment from across the country, and from other countries as well, because Mumbai has the best health infrastructure, especially in private hospitals. So, Mumbai is also a destination for medical tourism. So, last year at this time, about 60% to 70% of patients would have been from other parts of the country and abroad.But now, with COVID-19, we are facing a different situation, which needs different bed arrangement, management etc., which is why it is a problem when 30 percent to 40 percent of COVID-19 beds are occupied by people from outside Mumbai.There is a misconception that all industries have collapsed, except the hospital industry — which (people think) is flourishing. But hospitals, mainly private hospitals, are in a big loss--because of the COVID-19 situation, the rate is capped by the government. We cannot charge more than that. There are not many non-COVID-19 patients.So proportionately today, you have a much higher ratio of patients coming from outside Mumbai, which is placing a load on the system because a fair number of beds are dedicated only for COVID-19. Is that correct?Correct. For instance, in Bombay Hospital, we have two buildings--one for COVID, and one for non-COVID. The COVID building is always full. In the non-COVID building, people have started coming now. Earlier, they were in panic; they did not want to go to a hospital for fear of catching COVID-19. People are coming now, but still surgeries are only emergencies; a few elective surgeries are going on.So, if a patient were to have a non-COVID situation, they are likely to get a bed, even in an ICU, in Mumbai?Yes, non-COVID is totally open. There are beds. There is no problem with availability of beds for the non-COVID patients.What is the total number of beds you are managing, in a way, in the private hospital space in Mumbai?Right now, in the 33 big private hospitals--like Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy, Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, etc — we have 2,600 COVID-19 beds. Of these, 1,600 are oxygenated beds, and 590 ICU beds. In the 27 nursing homes we opened, we added 390 ICU beds and 1,700 oxygenated beds. In the government hospitals, we reduced the capacity of COVID beds because we opened up the non-COVID part also. For instance, Nair hospital was totally a dedicated COVID hospital. Now, 50 percent beds are for COVID and 50 percent for non-COVID.But we have increased capacity in our jumbo facilities. We have 11,000 oxygenated beds in these facilities--like in NSCI Worli, BKC, NESCO, Dahisar, Mulund. Jumbo facilities are not isolation or quarantine centres. They are full-fledged hospitals, with oxygenated beds, ventilators, bi-pap machines, nasal cannula machine, X-ray, sonography, 2D echo and a pathology lab in every facility. They have all kinds of medication — including the likes of] remidesivir, tocilizumab — and it is totally free of cost.We inspected the jumbo facilities to understand why people are not coming. There is a perception that these are only quarantine or isolation centres. As I said, they are full-fledged hospitals. Secondly, they feel the doctors may not be good. All the jumbo facilities will now be run by government medical college and hospital staff--like Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals. They already deployed two units each--each unit has 40-50 doctors. Further, all jumbo facilities will be monitored by big private hospitals--Bombay Hospital and Breach Candy will monitor the NSCI Worli Dome. Lilavati and Hinduja, which have top expert doctors, will look after the BKC jumbo facility. NESCO Goregaon facility will be looked after by Kokilaben and Nanavati hospitals. Mulund facility will be looked after by Fortis Hospital.Are there enough doctors and nurses to manage the patients in private hospitals, nursing homes and the jumbo facilities?Yes, in private hospitals and nursing homes, there is no shortage of doctors. In government [MCGM or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] hospitals too, there was no shortage of doctors and nurses. The only staff and manpower shortage we were facing was in the jumbo facilities. That is why we deployed medical college and hospital staff in these facilities. Further, we deployed top expert doctors from the private hospitals for ICU care. So from yesterday, there is no shortage of any staff in the jumbo facility.As an infectious disease specialist, looking at the patient flow, and at the condition in which they are coming to the hospital today, what is your sense on where we are in terms of management of this disease?This is a new disease, there are new challenges and learnings everyday. Every day, we change our guidelines. Sometimes we say that patients who are above 50 years should be hospitalised. Sometimes again, we say that for asymptomatic patients, home isolation is better.We are seeing that the virulence of this disease has decreased. Now, patients are not as critical as they were during April-June. That was a horrible time. Maybe patients are educated enough, they are keeping their diabetes controlled, taking enough precautions--and now, enough medications such as remdesivir are available. That definitely helps us a lot--it does not stop the virus, but reduces the viral load. So I feel, with the availability of medications, beds and oxygen, [we are able to manage better]. Oxygen is more important than a ventilator. Every patient does not need a ventilator.You are saying that most additional load that we are seeing, particularly in the ICUs, is because of patients coming from outside Mumbai. Is that likely to reduce or increase? And therefore, are we back to a situation like we had in May or June, even as the disease itself does not spread as much, but the patient load is continuing to rise?I feel the patient load will continue to rise till the end of September. After that, things will settle down. After the first week of October, I think the number of cases may decrease. But if it increases, we are totally geared up with the facilities. We have (enough) beds. In the jumbo facilities, 30-40 percent beds are still vacant; in private hospitals, 10-20 percent beds are vacant; in ICUs, 1-3 percent beds are vacant. It does not mean they are vacant all the time; but there is constant turnover.Earlier, we were doing only 4,000 tests per day in Mumbai. Mumbai is the first city to allow tests without a doctor’s prescription. Now everyday, we are doing 15,000 to 16,000 tests. We are chasing the virus. We are not worried about the numbers. We want to decrease the mortality rate and we are able to decrease it.\n",

They broke every rule in Parliament. It was a historic day. In the worst sense of the word. They cut RSTV feed so the country couldn’t see.'Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 passed amidst Opposition protests.Deputy Chairman Harivansh asks if the House agrees to extend proceedings from 1 pm till the disposal of the Bills. Shouting continues. Deputy Chairman asks members who have come out from their seats to the well to return'Working group on agriculture production set up by Manmohan Singh government in 2010 recommended that APMC and corporate license monopolies should not be allowed,' BJP MP Bhupender Yadav asks Congress in Upper House.Opposing the Agriculture Bills tabled by Narendra Singh Tomar, Congress MPPartap Singh Bajwa said that these Bills are ill-conceived and ill-timed and the Congress opposes it. 'We will not sign on this death warrant of farmers,' he said.The Bharatiya Kisan Union's Haryana unit will hold a statewide protest against the Centre's farm bills on Sunday during which they will block roads for three hours, even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed for deferring the stir and invited them for talksRajya Sabha is likely to take up the contentious farm bills on Sunday with the Congress and many opposition parties trying to put a united front to oppose these proposed legislations terming them as anti-farmer and pro-corporate, even as the ruling BJP is also reaching out to several regional outfits for support.The numbers, however, appear to be in favour of the ruling dispensation to get these bills passed from Rajya Sabha, while the lower house has already cleared them despite a key NDA member Shiromani Akali Dal vehemently opposing them.Some key BJP leaders are said to be in touch with various non-Congress opposition parties to seek support from their Rajya Sabha members for these bills.While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is yet to have a clear majority of its own in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, many regional parties have backed it for the last several sessions to ensure passage of various legislations proposed by the government.BJP leaders expressed confidence that they will get the support of over 130 members, including nine of the AIADMK and six of the YSR Congress – both of whom are not part of the ruling alliance if a division of votes is sought on these bills.Another regional party, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) was also being wooed by the BJP, but its chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against these bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country.The BJP itself has the highest tally with 86 seats, followed by 40 of the Congress.The three members of the SAD are sure to vote against the bills, but Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally and now in opposition, has expressed its support for these bills. The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha.Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition's ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s forceful defence of the three bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament''s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these bills, calling them \"anti-farmers\".Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislation suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together.Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks.The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday.These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government.With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as \"anti-farmers\" and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as \"historic\" and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price.A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels \"saddened\" that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ''mandis''.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as \"anti-farmers\", claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests.Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on September 14 and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Parliament Proceedings on SaturdayOn Saturday, the Lok Sabha passed the Taxation Amendment Bill after a detailed debate in which allegations of corruption flew across Opposition and Treasury benches.The Lower House also passed the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in an extended session.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, passed by the Lok Sabha includes extending deadlines for filing returns and for linking PAN and Aadhaar as well as allows for donations made to the PM CARES Fund to claim 100 percent deduction in taxable income.The Bill will replace the ordinance promulgated by the Centre in March.Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed two bills — the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, and the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill.Additionally, MoS Labour and Employment, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, introduced three bills in the Lok Sabha — The Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and The Code On Social Security, 2020.\n",

            "0.23892256617546082  ===>  Amid rising coronavirus cases in the country, a survey has revealed that 78 percent of COVID-19 patients who needed an ICU bed had to use “connections and clout”  while only four percent were able to secure a bed through the routine process.LocalCircles, a community social media platform that enables people and small businesses to escalate issues for policy and enforcement interventions, said it received many complaints from across the country about not being able to find an ICU bed at government or private hospitals and decided to conduct a survey to assess the situation.It received over 17,000 responses from over 211 districts across India. Of the total respondents, 52 percent were from Tier 1 cities, 26 percent from Tier 2 and 22 percent were from Tier 3, 4 and rural districts. Sixty-five percent of the respondents were men while 35 percent were women.At least 92 percent said it should be mandatory for all hospitals to list real-time ICU bed availability on their websites and entrances, as per the survey.LocalCircles' first question to citizens was about the experiences of people in their social network with regards to getting a COVID-19 ICU bed.To ensure that correct feedback is sought, respondents were requested to call up their contacts in case they were unaware about the detailed experience of their acquaintances and  family members while getting an ICU bed.Fifty-five percent of the respondents, who said that they did not have any person in their network needing a ICU bed, were taken out of the sample and the remaining responses were analysed. It was found that 38 percent respondents had to use clout/connections to secure the ICU bed while seven percent said they had to follow up extensively to secure the ICU bed; 40 percent said they had to use their clout/connections, follow up extensively and they also had to escalate the issue via social media or complain to the government to secure the ICU bed.Seven percent of the respondents said they had to bribe (cash or kind) hospital/government officials to get the ICU bed, while only four percent said they got the ICU bed without any of the above. Another four percent said they did not get an ICU bed at all.This shows that only four percent of those who needed a COVID-19 ICU bed were able to get it through the routine process, while 78 percent had to use connections and clout.In Delhi, for example, patients complained that the Delhi government’s app ‘Delhi Corona’ shows ICU beds available in some hospitals; however, when they call that hospital, they are told that the bed is not available, LocalCircles founder Sachin Taparia told Indian Express.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said there are around 1,000 ICU beds available in the National Capital. Around 1,500 non-ICU beds and over 500 ICU beds were added over the last few days, he said.\"The number of vacant beds is available on Delhi Corona app... nothing is being concealed,\" news agency PTI quoted him as saying.The health minister also attributed the high occupancy of ICU beds in private hospitals to people coming from outside.\"People coming in from outside prefer private hospitals. They make up their mind in advance and directly go to these four-five hospitals they have heard of... such as Max, Apollo and Fortis. That's why ICU beds are full there,\" he said.\"Most of them have occupied ICU beds in private hospitals. There are 1,500 such patients admitted to Delhi hospitals,\" he further stated.In the next question on LocalCircles' survey, people were asked, whether it should be made mandatory for hospitals to list real-time ICU bed availability on their websites and at entrances, given the shortage of ICU beds.A whopping 92 percent responded in favour of the measure while seven percent voted against it. The remaining one percent chose the \"can't say\" option.\"According to a lot of citizens, those with clout and connections are able to get an ICU bed even if they have mild symptoms while many common citizens including healthcare workers with severe symptoms are being denied an ICU bed or being granted the same much later. Several examples have been shared.,\" LocalCircles said in a release.India has reported over 54.87 lakh COVID-19 cases while 87,882 persons have succumbed to the disease till date.India has as many as 15,403 COVID-19 treatment facilities with 15,54,022 isolation beds, 63,758 ICU beds and 2,32,505 o-xygen supported beds, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey told the Rajya Sabha on Monday.With inputs from PTI\n",

The case fatality rate stood at 1.61 percent.India's COVID-19 count had crossed 20-lakh on 7 August, 30 lakh on 23  August, 40 lakh on 5 September and it went past 50 lakh on 16 September.\"Also,  52 percent of the new cases are concentrated in five states. These are also the states contributing maximum to the new recoveries,\" the ministry underlined.Maharashtra accounted for over 20,000 (22.16 percent) of the new cases. Both Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka accounted for more than 8,000 cases, it said.As many as 425 or 37 percent of the fatalities reported on Saturday were from Maharashtra, followed by Karnataka (114) and Uttar Pradesh (84), it said.There are 10,10,824 active cases in the country which comprise 18.72 percent of the total caseload, showed the health ministry data.According to the ICMR, a cumulative total of 6,36,61,060 samples have been tested up to 19 September with 12,06,806 samples being tested on Saturday.'No significant mutation of virus'Meanwhile, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan asserted that no significant or drastic mutation in strains of SARS-CoV-2 has been found in India till now.During a virtual interaction with his social media followers, Vardhan said that the ICMR has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time-points. Detailed results on mutations and evolution of the virus will be available in early October, he said.Replying to queries during the 'Sunday Samvad' interaction, Vardhan asserted that enough oxygen is being produced in the country and the health ministry is closely monitoring the situation.Vardhan informed that the ICMR had validated a few saliva-based tests for the detection of COVID-19, but no reliable test has been found. Companies with tests approved by US-FDA have still not approached the Government of India, he added.He further said that the country's apex health research body is actively exploring this test method and information will be released as soon as reliable options are available.The health minister noted that it would take a substantive amount of time for developing herd immunity to be able to cover about 70 percent of the population. Hence, the focus of the government is primarily towards putting together a strategy that combines containment and hospital management, he said.Schools to partially re-open in several statesSchools in several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Nagaland and Madhya Pradesh will re-open for Class 9 to 12 students on Monday, in keeping with the Centre's Unlock-4 guidelines, according to a Scroll report.All government-run and private schools across Jammu region will reopen partially for higher classes after six months of closure due to the pandemic, a senior government official said, assuring that all necessary arrangements are in place for the safety of students.However, she said the attendance of the students would be voluntary and based on the consent of their parents.We are partially reopening the schools outside containment zones for the students of 9 to 12 classes from tomorrow with terms and conditions in accordance with the guidelines of the government, Director School Education, Jammu zone, Anuradha Gupta told PTI.She said only 50 percent teachers would attend their duties as per the prepared roster, while the students of Classes 9 to 12 can attend their classes only with the written consent from their parents or guardian.Gupta said the department has worked out arrangements with the school management and they undertaken fumigation and sanitisation of the school premises. Besides ensuring social distancing, the schools will also ensure availability of adequate number of hand sanitisers, face masks and will follow the guidelines issued by the health department besides ensuring social distancing.The school management would also ensure medical help if needed, she said.The Punjab government also announced on Sunday that it would allow students of classes 9 to 12 to visit their schools in areas outside containment zones on a voluntary basis.However, some states, including Delhi and Karnataka, have announced that they will not allow students to visit schools from Monday, according to the Hindustan Times.Raipur to go under lockdownLate on Saturday night, Raipur Collector S Bharathi Dasan issued an order declaring Raipur district as a containment zone and restricted several activities from 9 pm on 21 September till midnight of 28 September, a state public relations department official said.\"Raipur district has so far reported over 26,000 COVID-19 cases and 900-1000 cases are being recorded daily. To break the chain of transmission, it has become necessary to declare the entire district a containment zone. Inter-district borders in Raipur will remain sealed during this duration,\" the order said.All Central, state, semi-government and private offices will remain closed. No public meeting or rally will be allowed, but government staff engaged in prevention and control of COVID-19 will continue to work as earlier, it said.\"All shops and commercial establishments, including grocery shops will be closed during the period. Medical shops will be allowed to remain open while home deliveries of medicines will be given priority. Milk shops will be open from 6am to 8am and then 5pm to 6:30 pm,\" an official said.Petrol pumps will provide fuel only to government vehicles, private vehicles engaged in medical emergencies, and to ambulances.LPG cylinder distributors are allowed to take orders only via telephone and provide home delivery, while liquor shops will remain closed. The order said industrial houses and construction units will have to make on-site residential arrangements for their labourers.Essential services, like health, electricity and water supply, sanitation works and emergency services have been kept out of the purview of restrictions, and those needing to move out of the district will need an e-pass, an official said.Lockdown has also been imposed for differing durations in several other urban areas of the states.Central team visits JammuA central team visiting Jammu called for 100 percent house-to-house survey, contact tracing and increasing the number of testing, especially using Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits, to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the region.The four-member team headed by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director SK Singh was discussing with senior government officers the steps to be taken for containing and controlling of the spread of COVID-19 following a spike in cases last month, said a spokesperson.Reviewing the measures through video conference meetings with district administration and health teams of six districts Samba, Ramban, Kishtwar, Kathua, Rajouri and Doda, the team highlighted the need for focus on the testing and surveillance of containment zones using door-to-door surveys.\"The team members urged the officials concerned to focus on influenza-like Illness (ILI) /Severe Acute Respiratory infection (SARI) cases, 100 percent house-to-house survey, contact tracing and increasing the number of testing, especially with RAT. They asked the officials to focus on the data analysis and stepping up the testing, contact tracing and surveillance of the areas from where more cases are detected so that chain can be broken,\" the spokesman said.He said the team suggested the measures to be implemented in the containment zones and asked them to involve ASHA and field Health staff to identify ILI cases so that testing of all can be done.\"Door-to-door survey was suggested for identifying high-risk persons like pregnant women or the elderly and those with comorbidity,\" he said.With inputs from PTI\n",

They broke every rule in Parliament. It was a historic day. In the worst sense of the word. They cut RSTV feed so the country couldn’t see.'Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 passed amidst Opposition protests.Deputy Chairman Harivansh asks if the House agrees to extend proceedings from 1 pm till the disposal of the Bills. Shouting continues. Deputy Chairman asks members who have come out from their seats to the well to return'Working group on agriculture production set up by Manmohan Singh government in 2010 recommended that APMC and corporate license monopolies should not be allowed,' BJP MP Bhupender Yadav asks Congress in Upper House.Opposing the Agriculture Bills tabled by Narendra Singh Tomar, Congress MPPartap Singh Bajwa said that these Bills are ill-conceived and ill-timed and the Congress opposes it. 'We will not sign on this death warrant of farmers,' he said.The Bharatiya Kisan Union's Haryana unit will hold a statewide protest against the Centre's farm bills on Sunday during which they will block roads for three hours, even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed for deferring the stir and invited them for talksRajya Sabha is likely to take up the contentious farm bills on Sunday with the Congress and many opposition parties trying to put a united front to oppose these proposed legislations terming them as anti-farmer and pro-corporate, even as the ruling BJP is also reaching out to several regional outfits for support.The numbers, however, appear to be in favour of the ruling dispensation to get these bills passed from Rajya Sabha, while the lower house has already cleared them despite a key NDA member Shiromani Akali Dal vehemently opposing them.Some key BJP leaders are said to be in touch with various non-Congress opposition parties to seek support from their Rajya Sabha members for these bills.While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is yet to have a clear majority of its own in the 245-member Rajya Sabha, many regional parties have backed it for the last several sessions to ensure passage of various legislations proposed by the government.BJP leaders expressed confidence that they will get the support of over 130 members, including nine of the AIADMK and six of the YSR Congress – both of whom are not part of the ruling alliance if a division of votes is sought on these bills.Another regional party, Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) was also being wooed by the BJP, but its chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday asked his party MPs to vote against these bills, alleging these would cause great injustice to farmers in the country.The BJP itself has the highest tally with 86 seats, followed by 40 of the Congress.The three members of the SAD are sure to vote against the bills, but Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally and now in opposition, has expressed its support for these bills. The Maharashtra party has three members in Rajya Sabha.Several other regional parties, including three-member Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party with eight seats, and BSP with four, have joined the opposition's ranks in protest against these bills but it may not prove enough to hinder their passage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s forceful defence of the three bills and blistering criticism of the Opposition for protesting against them on Thursday made it clear that he remains unfazed by the opposition and that his government will press on to get Parliament''s nod for these measures aimed at opening private avenues for farmers to sell their produce.His assertion came amid Congress and several other parties besides the SAD coming out strongly against these bills, calling them \"anti-farmers\".Farmers in states like Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against these proposed laws which, their leaders allege, will end up dismantling the existing government-backed support system they have.A number count of parties that have come out against these draft legislation suggests that there are as of now nearly 100 MPs opposing them. There is no clarity about the stand of some small parties which have around a dozen members put together.Since the Modi government assumed office for its second time in 2019, its rivals have not been able to scuttle any of its major bills due to a rise in the ranks of treasury benches and a corresponding fall in the opposition ranks.The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by Lok Sabha on Thursday, while the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill was passed on Tuesday.These bills seek to replace ordinances already promulgated by the government.With opposition parties dubbing the three bills as \"anti-farmers\" and the SAD quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, describing these proposed laws as \"historic\" and stating that they will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere at a better price.A day after resigning from Union Cabinet, senior SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said she feels \"saddened\" that her voice in support of farmers was not heard and demanded that the government should pause on these legislations by referring them to a parliamentary panel for wider consultations.The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ''mandis''.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as \"anti-farmers\", claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests.Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to all non-BJP parties to unite in Rajya Sabha and oppose the three bills that he claimed would leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation.At a meeting of the business advisory committee of Lok Sabha, which has floor leaders of all parties besides the government representatives and is chaired by the Speaker, most political parties favoured curtailment of the session, which started on September 14 and was scheduled to conclude on 1 October.A final decision will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs.Parliament Proceedings on SaturdayOn Saturday, the Lok Sabha passed the Taxation Amendment Bill after a detailed debate in which allegations of corruption flew across Opposition and Treasury benches.The Lower House also passed the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in an extended session.The Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, 2020, passed by the Lok Sabha includes extending deadlines for filing returns and for linking PAN and Aadhaar as well as allows for donations made to the PM CARES Fund to claim 100 percent deduction in taxable income.The Bill will replace the ordinance promulgated by the Centre in March.Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha passed two bills — the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, and the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill.Additionally, MoS Labour and Employment, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, introduced three bills in the Lok Sabha — The Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020, The Industrial Relations Code, 2020, and The Code On Social Security, 2020.\n",
            "tensor(0.8485)  ===>  The latest quarterly Gross Domestic Product data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation presents a gloomy picture. The Indian economy has contracted by a staggering 23.9 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year — with the labour-intensive construction sector reporting a massive slump of 50.3 percent. For a sector that was already under stress before the pandemic due to the poor financial health of many companies and dwindling output, this news has come as a shocker.But more significantly, the data provide a frightening picture of the impact the pandemic has had on the construction workers- a glimpse of which was also visible from the mass exodus of migrant workers to their villages during the lockdown.A rapid assessment survey conducted by Habitat for Humanity’s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter interviewed 974 respondents to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 on migrant workers in Maharashtra’s Pune and Ulhasnagar. The report reveals that nearly half the respondents belonged to the construction industry (47 percent), followed by bag manufacturing (23 percent), garment industry (13 percent) and the remaining 17 percent to other sectors. At least, 71 percent of all respondents received no wages after the lockdown and over 63 percent claimed to have no source of livelihood at their places of origin.The survey presents a distressing picture of the plight of migrant workers in the construction sector and other industries - and what the 50 percent fall in construction output means for the many who depend on it.Impact on the construction industry and its workforceThe construction industry in India is the second largest employer after agriculture and has an industry size of Rs 10.5 trillion. According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, prior to the lockdown, there were 20,000 ongoing construction projects in the country and work was being undertaken in as many as 18,000 sites.Together, these projects involved a workforce of over 8.5 million. Moreover, demand from affordable housing segment is expected to decline significantly due to constrained spending capacity of the target group. With more than 6.1 lakh affordable houses under construction buoyed by policy fillip such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the resultant growth in recent years — muted demand, reduced cash flows, labour shortage and cost escalations could severely hamper revival of the sector. When output from the sector is lost, the jobs and the incomes generated from those jobs are also lost. The loss in incomes was observed even in the Terwilliger Center survey, with only 16 percent of all workers interviewed receiving the same wages as before lockdown, and the remaining 84 percent receiving much less or no income. Further, even from the workers who received the wages, only around 10 percent found it sufficient enough to help them through the lockdown.With no money in hand and no alternative livelihood in the destination states, migrant workers were forced to rely on welfare measures from the government. Data from the Terwilliger Center survey shows that about 28 percent of them received no form of help or support from the government — putting their very lives at risk. It is no surprisem therefore, that almost 26 percent of the workers suffered hunger during the lockdown, with little or no access to food. In fact, for 40 percent workers, access to food and ration was one of their biggest concerns.In such a situation, the existence of active social protection for workers becomes imperative. The construction sector has two laws to provide protection and dignity to its workforce. The first, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and conditions of service) Act 1996 regulates the employment and conditions of service of building and other construction workers, and provides for their safety, health, and welfare. The second, the BOCW Cess Act, provides for the levy and collection of cess on the cost of construction incurred by employers, with a view to augment the resources of the BOCW Welfare Boards, used to provide for these workers.The rapid assessment survey highlights the glaring inadequacy of the workers’ registration system under the Act: 96 percent of the workers in the construction sector were not registered under the BOCW Act and thus could not avail its relief package. The survey further reveals that among the 455 respondents employed in the construction sector, 62 percent  were not even aware of BOCW, while 20 percent were aware of BOCW, but could not register themselves.To put this in perspective, in June 2020, Ministry of Labour and Employment stated that 20 million workers registered under BOCW were provided cash assistance during the lockdown. As per India’s Periodic Labour Force Survey of employment and unemployment, there were nearly 55 million construction workers in 2017–18. This demonstrates that only about 36 percent of the construction workers received the cash entitlements they deserved, making the situation precarious for the large majority of the workers, and often leaving them to fend for themselves.In reality, a large number of workers in the construction industry have been living in precarious conditions even before the pandemic. This is due to the rampant informality present in the construction sector, primarily due to its reliance on migrant labour recruited through a series of sub-contracting processes. About 87.4 percent of workers in the construction sector have been categorised as casual labour, according to the PLFS 2017-18, highlighting the level of informality that prevails in the industry.Informality is also evident through subcontracting — a process deeply embedded within the building construction work. A typical example of a sub-contracting hierarchy involves a realty and infrastructure company handing over specialised tasks to specific subcontracting companies, which in turn delegate hiring responsibilities to petty contractors, who may or may not have an appropriate license. These petty contractors, also known as labour sub-contractors, are responsible for recruiting and onboarding workers. Thus, the structure of recruitment is complex, multi-layered and hierarchical, especially in large construction firms.Petty contractors in such contracting value chain play a crucial role in mobilising large number of labourers needed by the construction industry. The heavy reliance on these contractors was evident from the survey as well; majority of the construction workers (58 percent) surveyed relied on contractors to find jobs, while 26 percent found employment on their own and 13 percent through referrals from friends or relatives.Labour economist Ravi Srivastava talks about how this dependence on contractors is more common among short term migrants, in this 2020 paper. \"Short term migrants are much more likely to enter the migrant labour market through contractors from whom they have taken an advance payment and are more likely to be involved in a debt-interlocked migration cycle,\" he writes.In addition, these short-term migrant workers are largely characterised by an absence of civic identity and citizenship at destination, poorer access to entitlements, labour market discrimination and working and living in substandard conditions. Though significant progress has been made in providing housing for economically weaker sections through the PMAY scheme, short-term migrants, who are multilocal in nature, are left out and often end up living in inadequate shelter in cities as they could neither afford nor access decent housing.They face double marginalisation in the destination states, owing to their identity as outsiders and also due to the informal nature of their occupation. They resort to living in labour colonies and rented accommodation in informal settlements, with no access to basic services. Further, the living conditions of such migrants are congested in nature and conducive for the rapid spread of viruses and diseases. The survey corroborated this - out of all migrant workers surveyed, only 15 percent had access to all necessary conditions required for prevention of COVID-19, such as access to serviceable toilets, clean drinking water, water for washing hands, and enough space to practice physical distancing.All this is emblematic of a larger malaise prevailing in the system- marked by an absence of social protection to the workforce that runs the economy. Seen from this perspective, the 50 percent fall in GVA of the construction sector could exacerbate hunger, loss of livelihood, and lead to distress migration and lack of dignity for workers. Findings from the Terwilliger Center study and several other field assessments since March 2020 indicate the prevalence of all these aspects in the lives of migrant workers.Beyond the official dataThere is a high likelihood that the decline of over 50 percent in the activity of the construction sector has been under-reported. This is because a country’s GDP, as economist Vivek Kaul writes, is based on formal-sector indicators; and the real state of the huge informal sector can be captured only over a period of time, as more and more data come in, not immediately. In India, given that data-collection was affected drastically during the lockdown and that the construction industry is subject to rampant informality and substantial sub-contracting, the impact on the sector, both in terms of loss of output and employment is likely to be worse.For instance, KPMG’s report on the impact of COVID-19 in the construction sector predicted a fall in the Gross Value Added of the construction sector to be 34 percent, (in the worst case scenario of the lockdown extending to 30 June) and the consequent fall in employment to be 25 percent (corresponding to the 34 percent fall in GVA). However, the latest fall in the construction sector GVA of 50.3 percent, based on partial data collection, belies all such expectations. More so, given the nature of construction industry, a fall in output would have a multiplier effect through backward linkages, causing further reduction of the economic activity and job losses. However, all is not lost yet.The rural economy and the role of housingWith a protracted economic recovery looming large, especially in industries such as construction that are dependent on migrant labour, there is an urgent need to revive the rural economy. Transitional remedial measures such as PM Garib Kalyan Yojana and enhanced budget allocation and expansion of works as well as workdays under MGNREGA can help in the short term revival but may not be sufficient given the magnitude of crisis and jobs to be created.Extending the PMAY Gramin program’s tenure and upskilling returnee construction labour on rural masonry skills can create more sustainable jobs besides productively utilizing their skills acquired in cities. This can also lead to improved quality of housing construction under PMAY Gramin.According to a recent GIZ report Improving Housing for Urban Poor - Learnings from BLC Implementation in Odisha”, it can be seen that 76 percent of PMAY beneficiaries are labourers and 56 percent infact are construction labourers. It is well known that remittances from migrant labour working in cities partly goes towards housing improvements in their hometowns. The current situation presents an opportunity to address the housing gaps among migrant households and enlist those who were left out; and also resolve the issue of incomplete houses caused by migration of beneficiaries to other places for work. Housing has also become the frontline defense against the coronavirus and in this context it is imperative that every migrant worker has access to adequate housing, in both origin and destination states.Willingness to migrate againOne of the important findings of the survey is that, despite the hardships endured in the place of work and in subsequently travelling back to their villages, 59 percent of surveyed migrants expressed willingness to return to their destination state. This willingness was higher among construction workers, where 68 percent expressed willingness to return to the destination state once the government allowed interstate travel. For many of these construction workers (76 percent), the lack of livelihood options in the origin state was a key driver influencing their decision. Not surprisingly, the survey reveals that the migrant workers' willingness to return to their place of work was contingent upon the employer providing them with travel arrangements, food and a safe, clean and hygienic workplace and proper accommodation- all basic necessities.Further, because of the nature of the construction sector, petty contractors are the key linchpins in recruiting workers and offering informal intermediation services to employers in mobilising labour. The survey suggests that builders and construction firms should step up in formally recognising their role and paying for their services, while keeping the relationship between the worker and employer linear. Employers can also explore partnerships with civil society organizations to sensitise, train and expand the services of petty contractors as facilitators of entitlements to migrant workers in the destination states.As a significant number of migrant workers are employed in the construction sector, implementation issues in the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Act must be addressed immediately. The welfare boards in destination states need to be inclusive and ease the registration process for migrant workers. One way to do that is by engaging with petty contractors to scale up migrant worker registrations. At the same time, builders and construction firms who contribute cess to the state governments must hold the state BOCW welfare boards accountable and ensure delivery of entitlements for registered workers.Doing away with domicile restrictions to access the Public Distribution System would ensure food security of migrants in the destination states as they return. As regards housing, India does not have a legal framework for the right to housing, which makes it difficult for migrants to acquire shelter and they end up relying on intermediaries or petty contractors for accommodation. Finding sustainable ways to develop and operate the affordable rental housing complexes for migrant workers through market-based models and utilising the Construction Workers Welfare Board funds for housing of migrant construction workers as recommended by the Working Group on Migration in 2017, could go a long way in improving the quality of lives of workers as well as help revive the GDP by rekindling demand.To access the full report, click herePriyansha is with India Migration Now, a South East Migration Foundation Venture based in Mumbai, India.

            "tensor(0.8345)  ===>  By Govindraj EthirajMumbai: The total number of COVID-19 cases in India has now crossed the 5 million mark. In Mumbai, the number is now over 175,000 with over 8,200 deaths. The hospital beds in the city, particularly in intensive care units, seem to be under much greater pressure than they were until a few weeks ago. Why is this happening? How is the administration responding to this?Indiaspend spoke to Gautam Bhansali, a specialist in general medicine and infectious diseases at Bombay Hospital in south Mumbai. He is also the chief coordinator between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the civic body, and the private hospitals in the city for managing the beds.Edited excerpts:Why is it that after a few months, we are suddenly seeing a sudden pressure on hospital beds, including intensive care units?We were in a much better position in July and August. In September, we have definitely seen a big surge in the number of cases. There are two or three reasons for it: One is that the lockdown has almost entirely been relaxed, and people are also coming from other places for treatment. Due to that, you could say, it is like a second wave--cases have increased in Mumbai. But we need to understand why the lockdown was enforced. It was to educate people, spread awareness as to what is to be done to fight COVID-19. It is a new disease, a new challenge and a new learning for everybody. Meanwhile, we needed to prepare health infrastructure. Our health infrastructure was not ready when this disease struck us, around March. We needed to create negative pressure in the ICUs and in the ward, set up different entry and exit points (for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients).Now that the number of cases has increased, we are totally geared up with enough beds. There was some shortage of beds in between. We closed down some nursing homes one month back because there were some issues there--complaints of overcharging and high mortality rate. Those issues have been almost sorted out.You are talking about those 73 nursing homes that were taken off COVID-19 duty. Of these, 27 have now been reopened. Is that correct?On 14 September, we had a meeting with the municipal commissioner and the chief minister--as the number of cases has increased, and we assume that the number is going to increase further. Plus, there is an influx of patients from other places too--from Sangli, Dhule, Kolhapur, Nasik, Pune, etc. Cases are coming to Mumbai from all over the state. People want to get treated in Mumbai because they feel Mumbai has better health infrastructure, best doctors, skilled health professionals and that they will get the best treatment. So, we opened the 27 nursing homes, which have more than 25 beds each. They are well regulated, have MD doctors (with advanced medical degrees) and critical care specialists.If you have 100 beds, for instance, how many are now occupied by people from outside Mumbai?About 30 percent to 40 percent of the people admitted in these hospitals--nursing homes and big private hospitals--are from outside the Mumbai metropolitan region--from Bhiwandi, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, etc.And what would that number be for pre-COVID times--for instance, at this time last year?People come to Mumbai for treatment from across the country, and from other countries as well, because Mumbai has the best health infrastructure, especially in private hospitals. So, Mumbai is also a destination for medical tourism. So, last year at this time, about 60% to 70% of patients would have been from other parts of the country and abroad.But now, with COVID-19, we are facing a different situation, which needs different bed arrangement, management etc., which is why it is a problem when 30 percent to 40 percent of COVID-19 beds are occupied by people from outside Mumbai.There is a misconception that all industries have collapsed, except the hospital industry — which (people think) is flourishing. But hospitals, mainly private hospitals, are in a big loss--because of the COVID-19 situation, the rate is capped by the government. We cannot charge more than that. There are not many non-COVID-19 patients.So proportionately today, you have a much higher ratio of patients coming from outside Mumbai, which is placing a load on the system because a fair number of beds are dedicated only for COVID-19. Is that correct?Correct. For instance, in Bombay Hospital, we have two buildings--one for COVID, and one for non-COVID. The COVID building is always full. In the non-COVID building, people have started coming now. Earlier, they were in panic; they did not want to go to a hospital for fear of catching COVID-19. People are coming now, but still surgeries are only emergencies; a few elective surgeries are going on.So, if a patient were to have a non-COVID situation, they are likely to get a bed, even in an ICU, in Mumbai?Yes, non-COVID is totally open. There are beds. There is no problem with availability of beds for the non-COVID patients.What is the total number of beds you are managing, in a way, in the private hospital space in Mumbai?Right now, in the 33 big private hospitals--like Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy, Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, etc — we have 2,600 COVID-19 beds. Of these, 1,600 are oxygenated beds, and 590 ICU beds. In the 27 nursing homes we opened, we added 390 ICU beds and 1,700 oxygenated beds. In the government hospitals, we reduced the capacity of COVID beds because we opened up the non-COVID part also. For instance, Nair hospital was totally a dedicated COVID hospital. Now, 50 percent beds are for COVID and 50 percent for non-COVID.But we have increased capacity in our jumbo facilities. We have 11,000 oxygenated beds in these facilities--like in NSCI Worli, BKC, NESCO, Dahisar, Mulund. Jumbo facilities are not isolation or quarantine centres. They are full-fledged hospitals, with oxygenated beds, ventilators, bi-pap machines, nasal cannula machine, X-ray, sonography, 2D echo and a pathology lab in every facility. They have all kinds of medication — including the likes of] remidesivir, tocilizumab — and it is totally free of cost.We inspected the jumbo facilities to understand why people are not coming. There is a perception that these are only quarantine or isolation centres. As I said, they are full-fledged hospitals. Secondly, they feel the doctors may not be good. All the jumbo facilities will now be run by government medical college and hospital staff--like Sion, Nair and KEM hospitals. They already deployed two units each--each unit has 40-50 doctors. Further, all jumbo facilities will be monitored by big private hospitals--Bombay Hospital and Breach Candy will monitor the NSCI Worli Dome. Lilavati and Hinduja, which have top expert doctors, will look after the BKC jumbo facility. NESCO Goregaon facility will be looked after by Kokilaben and Nanavati hospitals. Mulund facility will be looked after by Fortis Hospital.Are there enough doctors and nurses to manage the patients in private hospitals, nursing homes and the jumbo facilities?Yes, in private hospitals and nursing homes, there is no shortage of doctors. In government [MCGM or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] hospitals too, there was no shortage of doctors and nurses. The only staff and manpower shortage we were facing was in the jumbo facilities. That is why we deployed medical college and hospital staff in these facilities. Further, we deployed top expert doctors from the private hospitals for ICU care. So from yesterday, there is no shortage of any staff in the jumbo facility.As an infectious disease specialist, looking at the patient flow, and at the condition in which they are coming to the hospital today, what is your sense on where we are in terms of management of this disease?This is a new disease, there are new challenges and learnings everyday. Every day, we change our guidelines. Sometimes we say that patients who are above 50 years should be hospitalised. Sometimes again, we say that for asymptomatic patients, home isolation is better.We are seeing that the virulence of this disease has decreased. Now, patients are not as critical as they were during April-June. That was a horrible time. Maybe patients are educated enough, they are keeping their diabetes controlled, taking enough precautions--and now, enough medications such as remdesivir are available. That definitely helps us a lot--it does not stop the virus, but reduces the viral load. So I feel, with the availability of medications, beds and oxygen, [we are able to manage better]. Oxygen is more important than a ventilator. Every patient does not need a ventilator.You are saying that most additional load that we are seeing, particularly in the ICUs, is because of patients coming from outside Mumbai. Is that likely to reduce or increase? And therefore, are we back to a situation like we had in May or June, even as the disease itself does not spread as much, but the patient load is continuing to rise?I feel the patient load will continue to rise till the end of September. After that, things will settle down. After the first week of October, I think the number of cases may decrease. But if it increases, we are totally geared up with the facilities. We have (enough) beds. In the jumbo facilities, 30-40 percent beds are still vacant; in private hospitals, 10-20 percent beds are vacant; in ICUs, 1-3 percent beds are vacant. It does not mean they are vacant all the time; but there is constant turnover.Earlier, we were doing only 4,000 tests per day in Mumbai. Mumbai is the first city to allow tests without a doctor’s prescription. Now everyday, we are doing 15,000 to 16,000 tests. We are chasing the virus. We are not worried about the numbers. We want to decrease the mortality rate and we are able to decrease it.\n",
            "tensor(0.8284)  ===>  India's COVID-19 caseload rose to 54.88 lakh on Monday with 86,961 people testing positive in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry said.The total number of recoveries rose to almost 44 lakh, pushing the recovery rate to 80.12 percent.With 93,356 COVID-19 patients being discharged in the last 24 hours, India recorded more than 90,000 recoveries for the third consecutive day on Monday.In a statement, the health ministry said that the country currently \"tops the global figure\" of total recoveries.\"India has crossed the significant landmark of more than 80 percent national recovery rate. On a continuous stretch of high recoveries, India has also reported more than 90,000 recoveries for the third day in succession,\" it added.Twelve states and Union Territories have registered recovery rate of more than the national average, while 79 percent of the new recovered cases are from 10 states and UTs.\"The total recovered cases are close to 44 lakh (43,96,399) today. India tops the global figure of total recoveries. It accounts for more than 19 percent of the world total,\" the ministry said.Meanwhile, the ministry also said that the COVID-19 case fatality rate has further declined to 1.6 percent.Of the total cases (54,87,580), 10,03,299 are active cases. The active cases comprise 18.28 percent of the total caseload, the ministry data showed.India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20 lakh mark on 7 August, 30 lakh on 23 August, 40 lakh on 5 September, and it went past 50 lakh on 16 September.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 6,43,92,594 samples have been tested so far, with 7,31,534 samples being tested on Sunday.However, The Times of India reported that in view of the surge of coronavirus cases in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to hold review meetings with chief ministers on Wednesday.Taj Mahal reopens after six monthsThe iconic Taj Mahal was opened to tourists on Monday, after a gap of more than six months since it was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Reports said that as a precautionary measure against the virus, the number of visitors being allowed access to the monument has been limited to 5,000 a day. The tourists will be allowed entry in two batches of 2,500, and tickets are being sold only online or via the app, Indian Express reported.ANI quoted Archeological Survey of India president Sarvottam Singh as saying around 500 tourists visited the monument during the first shift on Monday. The Taj Mahal reportedly sees a footfall of 70 to 80 lakh visitors every year.Schools in some states reopenSchools in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, and Andhra Pradesh reopened on Monday for the first time after the lockdown was imposed in March. The state governments were given the authority to review the situation and take a decision on reopening schools as part of the Centre's 'Unlock 4' guidelines.The states that decided to reopen schools on Monday, said the attendance of students was \"voluntary\" and also sought written consent from parents sending their children to school.In Jammu and Kashmir, only a few students turned up to attend special classes on Monday as schools for higher classes reopened in the Union Territory.Principal secretary, School Education and Skill Development, Asgar Hassan Samoon said the reopening of schools was not meant for regular classes.\"I was on a visit to Reasi district and only five to seven students were present in different schools and attending the special meetings with their teachers meant to clear their doubts,\" director, school education, Jammu, Anuradha Gupta told PTI.She said the school management has been directed to devise a mechanism to ensure the students make the best of the opportunity and come out with a roster to fulfil the requirement of the students.The decision of the government to reopen the schools came under sharp criticism from Opposition parties, including the National Conference and the Congress, who questioned the rationale behind the opening of school from classes 9 to 12 amid the pandemic.\"We have not opened the schools for regular classes. The partial reopening is to facilitate the students to clear their doubts in any subject in their classrooms while following all the precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19,\" Gupta said.The school education department has worked out arrangements with the school management, which undertook fumigation and sanitisation and made available an adequate number of hand sanitisers and face masks to students.Meanwhile, the Punjab government has allowed students of classes 9 to 12 to visit their schools in areas outside containment zones on voluntary basis.However, this permission will be subject to written consent of parents/guardians from 21 September as per Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 8 September, the state government said in a statement.The state home department has issued detailed instructions to also permit skill or entrepreneurship training in National Skill Training Institutes, Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), short term training centres registered with the National Skill Development Corporation or State Skill Development Missions or other ministries of the Government of India or the state governments, the release said.Likewise, activities of National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD), Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) and their training providers have also been allowed from 21 September subject to strict adherence of the said SOPs, it added.On the other hand, states like Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand, West Bengal announced schools will not reopen this week.'30% of COVID patients from other states'Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday that said 30 percent of the COVID-19 patients admitted in city hospitals are from other states, and added that most of them have been occupying ICU beds at private facilities.Amid a rise in the number of non-resident patients, the Delhi government has decided to collect data of their deaths separately, he said, adding that the National Capital has the \"lowest death rate\" in the country.Based on data of the last 10 days, the death rate in Delhi stands at 0.77 percent. \"Around 30 percent COVID-19 patients admitted to Delhi hospitals are from outside the city,\" he told reporters.\"People coming in from outside prefer private hospitals. They make up their mind in advance and directly go to these four-five hospitals they have heard of... such as Max, Apollo and Fortis. That's why ICU beds are full there,\" he said.\"Most of them have occupied ICU beds in private hospitals. There are 1,500 such patients admitted to Delhi hospitals,\" he said.The minister, however, said there are around 1,000 ICU beds available in Delhi at present. Around 1,500 non-ICU beds and more than 500 ICU beds have been added over the last few days, he said.\"The number of vacant beds is available on Delhi Corona app... nothing is being concealed,\" he said.Jain said data related to deaths of non-resident patients is now being collected separately.State-wise COVID-19 deathsOf the 1,130 fresh deaths, 455 were reported from Maharashtra, 101 from Karnataka, 94 from Uttar Pradesh, 61 from West Bengal, 60 from Tamil Nadu, 57 from Andhra Pradesh, 56 from Punjab, 27 from Madhya Pradesh, 37 from Delhi and 29 from Haryana.Seventeen deaths took place in Gujarat, 16 in Kerala, 14 each in Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Rajasthan, 13 each in Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh, 10 in Odisha.Nine fatalities have been reported each in Telangana and Goa, six in Tripura, four each in Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, three each in Bihar and Sikkim and two each in Manipur and Jharkhand.Of the total 87,882 deaths, Maharashtra has reported the maximum at 32,671, followed by 8,811 in Tamil Nadu, 8,023 in Karnataka, 5,359 in Andhra Pradesh, 4,982 in Delhi, 5,047 in Uttar Pradesh, 4,359 in West Bengal, 3,319 in Gujarat and 2,813 in Punjab.So far, 1,970 people have died of COVID-19 in Madhya Pradesh, 1,336 in Rajasthan, 1,149 in Haryana, 1,042 in Telangana, 1,001 in Jammu and Kashmir, 864 in Bihar, 701 in Odisha, 617 in Jharkhand, 677 in Chhattisgarh, 562 in Assam, 535 in Kerala and 491 in Uttarakhand.Puducherry has registered 462 fatalities, Goa 351, Tripura 245, Chandigarh 123, Himachal Pradesh 120, Andaman and Nicobar Islands 52, Manipur 57, Ladakh 49, Meghalaya 36, Sikkim 28, Nagaland 15, Arunachal Pradesh 13, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu two.Week-long lockdown in Chhattisgarh from todayAs Chhattisgarh's COVID-19 caseload rose by over 20,000 cases this week, authorities have announced a week-long \"complete\" lockdown in 10 districts effective from Monday, The Indian Express reported.Raipur, the state's capital, has been declared a containment zone till 28 September, the report added.\"In view of the sharp rise in cases, collectors of Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg, Raigarh, and 6 other districts decided to impose a complete lockdown.

            "tensor(0.8071)  ===>  Kolkata: On Saturday, within hours of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) announcing the arrest of six suspected Al Qaeda operatives from West Bengal’s Murshidabad – the district having India’s highest Muslim population (4.7 million in 2011) – the top Bengal leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), started taking digs at the state’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) government for allegedly allowing Bengal to turn into ‘a hub of jihadi activities’ for the sake of her ‘politics of vote-bank’.“The arrests are a massive and sensitive issue with respect to national security,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh said in a video message uploaded on his Facebook page on Saturday. “From Bangladeshi terrorists to operatives of SIMI (Students’ Islamic Movement of India), Al Qaeda, and the IS (Islamic State), these people find shelters in several districts of West Bengal. I have a hunch that the state government knowingly provides them shelter to reap political benefits.”Ghosh alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not cooperating with the Centre in getting land for erecting fences along the porous borders with Bangladesh because terror operatives who sneak in from the neighbouring country work towards her political purpose.“The TMC and the terrorists have a give and take policy. The TMC helps infiltrators get false nationality documents and now, the party is colluding with the Maoists and Islamic terrorists to eliminate their political opponents,” Ghosh later said.Notably, the three others who were arrested from Ernakulam district in Kerala in a simultaneous raid by the NIA also hail from Murshidabad.Over the past five years, Central and state agencies have arrested alleged operatives of the IS, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh, or JMB, from the state. Bengal shares 2,217 kilometres of border with Bangladesh. Nearly half it remains unfenced to date.In a press statement issued on Saturday, the NIA said that ‘large quantity of incriminating materials including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devices’ had been seized from the possession of the arrested persons.They were ‘radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social media’ and ‘were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Region’, the NIA said, adding that they were ‘actively indulging in fundraising’ and that some of them had a plan to visit New Delhi procure arms and ammunition.On Sunday, the BJP’s state unit general secretary Sayantan Basu upped the ante on the state government, saying the party had been rightly pointing out since 2014 that there was a plan to turn West Bengal into West Bangladesh.“We warned that the government’s patronage of unregulated madrasahs was creating (Osama bin) Laden-factories. The latest arrests were of persons born and brought up here. We no longer have only terrorists who infiltrated from Bangladesh and got their (nationality) documents here but now we also have our homegrown ones, thanks to the chief minister’s policy of going to any extent to appease a community of 30 percent,” Basu said.Bengal BJP leaders use ‘thirty percent’ usually to refer to Muslims, who made 27 percent of the state’s population, according to the Census of 2011.The TMC tried to divert the salvos at the Centre. “The border is protected by the Border Security Force (BSF), which operates under the Union government. What were the BSF and other Central agencies doing when dangerous terrorists crossed over the borders?” TMC Lok Sabha MPs Sougata Roy asked. Kalyan Banerjee, also a Lok Sabha MP, echoed him.However, political analysts and independent observers said the arrests were going to add to the BJP’s ammo for their political campaign in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections, as the spread of Islamic terror networks in the state has been one of the BJP’s key issues against the state government over the past six years.The reaction of Sujan Chakraborty, the leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly, indicated that he apprehended the BJP would gain mileage from these arrests. “What was the state administration doing? Were they sleeping? Why are they giving opportunities to the Centre?” he asked.‘Far-reaching impact’Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata, said that the Murshidabad arrests were going to have ‘a far-reaching’ impact on the state’s politics ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections.“Terror links to the state have helped the BJP since 2014 in building its campaign branding the Mamata Banerjee government as a patron of Islamic radicalism. Now, it’s time for their campaign to intensify,” the psephologist said.Bengal’s link to cross-border terror organisations first came to the limelight in October 2014, when an accidental blast at Khagragarh in Burdwan district opened the lid of a flourishing network of JMB across the districts of Murshidabad, Birbhum, Burdwan, and Nadia -- all having a significant Muslim population.The JMB was banned in Bangladesh in 2005 and the investigation in the 2014 blast revealed some of Bangladesh’ most-wanted terrorists were building the organisation’s India networks staying in West Bengal over the past few years.Soon after the revelation of JMB links to the Khagragarh blast, the BJP and other organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Hindu Jagran Manch — launched a sustained campaign seeking ‘jihadi-mukto Bangla’, or a Bengal free from Islamic terror operatives.Since then the NIA, and the state police as well, made a series of arrests of operatives linked to the JMB’s pro-Al Qaeda faction and the pro-IS faction, from different Bengal districts. Some of them were associated with small, unregulated madrasahs is nondescript localities. Some of the blast accused were later arrested by authorities in Bangladesh after they crossed over to that country. Overall, more than two dozen JMB operatives, including Indian and Bangladeshi nationals, have been arrested from the state.In 2017, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), or the highest decision-making body of the RSS, adopted a resolution expressing ‘grave concern over the unabated rise in violence by Jehadi elements in West Bengal, encouragement to the anti-national elements by the state government due to its Muslim vote bank politics’. The resolution called upon ‘the countrymen to create awareness against this Jihadi violence and communal politics of the state government’.During the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 when the state witnessed widespread protests against the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Bengal BJP leaders repeatedly cited terror operatives’ links with the state to justify their demand for a citizenship screening exercise to weed out infiltrators.After Saturday’s arrests, Ajay Kumar Nandi, the eastern regional sanghachalak (president) of the RSS, said that the state government must take the responsibility for the mushrooming of terror networks.“There should be a ceaseless flow of information between the state government and the Centre on terrorist activities. But there is no claim even on part of the state government that they supplied the Centre with any information. This is a question of national security and politics should have no part in influencing a government’s role. The state government will have to answer before the people,” Nandi said.Political observers said they could foresee the political ramifications of the arrests. According to Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, a former principal of Presidency College in Kolkata, the BJP will sharpen its campaign against the state government and the state’s ruling party will find itself in a defensive position.“The BJP has been saying for the past five-six years that Bengal has turned into a hub of terrorist activities due to Mamata Banerjee’s policies that encouraged infiltration. They also accused her of giving patronage to radical Islamists. Now, they will claim to be standing vindicated,” Mukhopadhyay said.Biswanath Chakraborty said that the BJP will also look the exploit the issue projecting the rationality of the CAA and NRC.“The TMC will remain quiet and take a soft stance, without committing itself to any position. They certainly do not want to be seen as acting against the national interest. However, the TMC is more than likely to launch a whispering campaign and make attempts to find a converging point with the voices that allege socio-economically backward Muslims are being unjustly targeted by the Centre,” Chakraborty said.Recent rapid activities The NIA stepped up its activities involving possible terror links to West Bengal in 2020. They have registered as many as six cases of suspected terrorist activities involving the state in this year, compared to only one each in 2016, 2015, and 2014. Most of the arrests of alleged JMB operatives that took place during 2014 and 2019 were connected to the accidental blast in Burdwan in 2014.In April 2020, the NIA took over the investigation into the case of a 21-year-old women college student’s alleged links with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Tania Parvin, a resident of Baduria in North 24-Parganas district, an area bordering Bangladesh, was first arrested by the state police in March.The second case that the NIA took over in April was regarding the discovery of a major illegal firecracker factory at Naihati area in North 24-Parganas district. A fire at the factory led to a blast, causing five deaths on the spot and leaving two others badly injured.In May, the NIA took over a case of January 2020 in which the home of a Malda resident was found to be a storehouse of explosives. This storage, too, had come to the light after an explosion took place at the residence.Early in September, the NIA took over the investigation into two cases from the state police. One of them was a one-year-old case of an explosion at the home of a resident of Birbhum district. The state police had started an investigation in September 2019. The other case, too, was of storage of explosives and crude bombs at the home of a Birbhum district resident. The state police had started an investigation in the previous month.Besides, the special task force of Gujarat policed picked up a man from North 24-Parganas district in August for having LeT links.The NIA also reopened an 11-year-old case against Chhatradhar Mahato, who served as a spokesperson of a Maoist-backed tribal outfit during 2008-09. He was released earlier this year after serving 10 years in jail and joined the TMC soon after. TMC leaders had alleged that the NIA was being used by the Centre to harass and intimidate Mahato. After facing the NIA’s grilling several times in August, Mahato has now been asked to appear before an NIA court.Ranjit Sur, vice-president of Association for Protection of Human Rights (APDR), the state’s largest human rights organisation, said he suspects the NIA could be acting in the political interests of the BJP. He was expecting arrests of more persons from West Bengal with alleged terror links in the coming days, he said.“We do not yet know much about the persons arrested from Murshidabad and Ernakulam. However, the role of NIA into the investigation of Maharashtra’s Elgar Parishad case and the recent reopening of a case against Chhatradhar Mahato prompts us to strongly suspect political interest behind NIA’s moves. It has come to our knowledge that the persons arrested from Murshidabad were associated with the movement against CAA. There are reasons to suspect that the arrests could be an attempt to weaken the anti-CAA movement,” Sur said.Incidentally, Ghosh, too, spoke of the anti-CAA movement with reference to the Murshidabad arrests.“Murshidabad turns out to be a hub of terrorists. From JMB to Al Qaeda, every terror group has a presence here. And it was Murshidabad where the anti-CAA movement took the most violent shape in the state. It appears that I had rightly pointed out at that time (December 2019) that the anti-CAA protesters indulging in violence had terror links,” Ghosh said on Sunday.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a TMC Rajya Sabha MP said that the party would take time before coming to any conclusion on whether there has been any political motive behind these arrests.“Our government is very serious about terror networks and the state police have made a series of arrests. However, we are aware that the BJP has a plan to frame rules for the CAA in the coming few months and re-launch its campaign in support of the CAA ahead of the Assembly elections. At present, we prefer to watch their next steps,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.The CAA, which offers citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from India’s neighbouring Islamic countries, is one of the BJP’s key weapons to win over the Bangladeshi Hindu refugees settled in West Bengal. The TMC has been strongly opposing both CAA and NRC, accusing the former of being discriminatory towards Muslims.The author is a Kolkata-based journalist and author of ‘Mission Bengal: A Saffron Experiment’\n",
            "tensor(0.8023)  ===>  The ICMR is actively exploring saliva-based test for detection of COVID-19, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday and asserted that no significant or drastic mutation in strains of SARS-CoV-2 has been found in India till now.During an interaction with his social media followers, Vardhan informed them the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus collected for several months over different time-points.Detailed results on mutations and evolution of the virus will be available in early October, he said.Replying to queries during the 'Sunday Samvad' platform, Vardhan further said enough oxygen is being produced in the country and the health ministry is closely monitoring the situation.According to a health ministry statement, he reminded everyone that the ministry had dispatched oxygen concentrators to rural parts of the country, to avert the logistic issues that have come to light.About saliva-based test for COVID-19, Vardhan noted that the ICMR has validated a few tests, but no reliable test has been found and companies with tests approved by US-FDA have still not approached the Government of India.He added that the country's apex health research body is actively exploring this test method and will inform as soon as reliable options are available.Regarding the Centre's achievement of engineering polio eradication in India, he reminded the audience that coronavirus is a novel pathogen and unlike polio, literature for it is absent.India's handling of disease outbreaks in the past such as SARS, Ebola and plague will play a major role in containing coronavirus, Vardhan said.\"The minister assured another (social media) follower that no significant or drastic mutations have been found in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in India (available in GISAID, global database), till now,\" according to the health ministry statement.Vardhan said 155 families of COVID Warriors have claimed relief under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting COVID-19. These include 64 doctors, 32 auxiliary nurse midwives and multipurpose healthcare workers, 14 ASHA workers and 45 other frontline workers who lost their lives.He also noted that it would take a substantive amount of time for developing herd immunity to be able to cover about 70 per cent of the population. Hence the focus of the government is primarily towards putting together a strategy that combines containment and hospital management, the minister said.Being a doctor himself, Vardhan answered questions on the clinical management of COVID-19 in great detail dispelling myths surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and plasma therapy in treating coronavirus patients. He also explained to his audience how coronavirus becomes fatal for the elderly and those with comorbidity.He also sought to dispel fears caused by the suspension of trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, saying vaccine development is a complex process and trials have restarted only after an independent investigative expert committee permitted them to proceed.\"He explained the difference between various vaccines under clinical trial in India and that since formulations, doses, route of administration are different for the vaccines, their mechanisms of action are also different.\"However, the desirable outcome of each vaccine is much the same, that is ensuring healthy individuals with immunity against the novel coronavirus,\" the statement said.During the 'Sunday Samvad', he shared several tips for the mental wellbeing of senior citizens.About concrete measures planned to handle public health emergencies in the future, Vardhan said, the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' will strengthen the nation to an extent where \"we will be able to overcome any eventuality including another pandemic\".The health minister said 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' underlines the government's commitment towards increased investments in public health and other health reforms to prepare India for future pandemics.A major proposal under consideration at the Expenditure Finance Committee level includes strengthening surveillance of infectious diseases and outbreak response including that for points of entry, the establishment of dedicated infectious disease management hospital blocks in district hospitals and Integrated Public Health Laboratories, he added.Vardhan also spoke on the role of traditional medicine in the present context and informed those who attended the 'Samvad' event that the AYUSH Ministry has developed research protocols for validating claims of various Ayush practitioners for COVID-19 solutions although no formulation has been validated as a specific drug.Vardhan also answered queries regarding India's plan to divert human resources to science and the role of government policy in achieving a clean environment witnessed during the coronavirus-induced lockdown.\n",
            "tensor(0.7972)  ===>  Lakhs of migrant workers who returned to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown are eagerly waiting for their ration cards in order to avail subsidised food grains allocated under the Public Distribution System in this time of crisis under. An RTI reply has revealed the state has over 18 lakh ration card applications pending with a whopping 91.9 percent of them pending beyond the stipulated 30 days for approval.Uttar Pradesh has witnessed maximum number of migrant workers in the country with more than 31 lakhs having returned from other states during the lockdown, the state's chief secretary had informed on 4 June, 2020.On 12 May, 2020, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given specific directions that those in need and eligible for subsideised ration should be provided with ration cards, including migrant workers.Between late March when the lockdown was announced in India and the month of May, the state has reportedly issued more than 5.8 lakh ration cards. Yet, 18,84,537 (or 10.2 percent) of the total applications for new ration cards are pending in the state.In all, the state received 1,85,57,659 applications under the State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG) system run by the Food and Civil Supplies Department of Uttar Pradesh. This information has been provided by the department in response to an RTI application filed by this author.While the response from the department does not mention the time period in which these applications were received, the date mentioned for the data compiled by the department is 31 July, 2020.The author has enquired from the department regarding the time period for the applications received and the details are awaited.As per the RTI response, out of the total pending applications, only 1,58,251 or 8.1 percent are pending within the stipulated time period of 30 days for application approval, while 17,31,686 (or a whopping 91.9 percent) are those pending beyond 30 days.Of the total 1.86 crore applications received, the department has accepted 61,29,525 applications (or 33 percent) while 1,05,43,597 (or 56.8 percent) applications have been rejected.Over 30 lakh migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh during Lockdown. APThe information released via RTI also gives a district-wise breakdown of the ration card applications as well. Out of total 75 districts in the state, the highest number of applications have been received in Sitapur district in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. The district also has the highest number of rejections.The least number of applicatios were received in Sonbhadra district in Western Uttar Pradesh. Sonbhadra also ranks lowest in terms of ration card applications approved, rejected as well as pending. Kanpur Nagar in central Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of applications awaiting approval.Among the four regions in Uttar Pradesh — Western, Eastern, Central and Bundelkhand — the highest average number of applications per district have been received in Central Uttar Pradesh while the least have been received in the Bundelkhand region.An analysis of the ration card applications processed by the Food and Civil Supplies Department as stated in the RTI response, revealed a strong positive correlation between the average gross domestic product (GDP) per district (as per the 2017-18 official data from Uttar Pradesh Directorate of Economics and Statistics) and the average number of applications received per district in each of the four regions.Analysis of total applications shows that the more is the average GDP per district of a particular region, the more are the average number of applications received, betraying the logic that people in wealthier regions are less reliant on PDS.However, an analysis of the total existing ration card holders in the four regions paints the opposite picture.There is a fairly strong negative correlation between the region-wise average GDP per district and the average existing ration card holders per district, respectively. What this means is that the more is the average GDP per district of the region, the lesser is the average number of ration card holders per district in each region.Table 1: Region-wise Ration Card StatisticsRegionsNumber of Applications ReceivedAverage Gross Net Product per District (Crores)Average Ration Cards per DistrictBundelkhand118317.48898.393473909.9Central UP368249.222130.62363557.7Eastern UP237428.312363.66504035.3Western UP250992.422034.79485337.2Source: UP Directorate of Economics and Statistics (for economic data); Food and Civil Supplies Department (for ration card data, accessed on 4 September 2020); RTI response (ration card applications) As of 4 September, the total number of ration cards in the state stood at more than 3.58 crores with more than 3.17 crores priority households, which include both the Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Above Poverty Line (APL) households as per the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA). At the same time, there are more than 40.77 Antyodaya ration card holders in the state.

Food and Civil Supplies Department (for ration card data, accessed on 4 September 2020); RTI response (ration card applications) Surprisingly, Bundelkhand, despite having the lowest average per district GDP, has received the lowest number of average applications for new ration cards per district. It should be noted that the region is widely perceived as underdeveloped and suffering from large scale hunger.In fact, Bundelkhand is the only region with a strong negative correlation between the per capita income of districts and the number of applications, ie, the more is the per capita income the lesser is the number of applications received in the districts of the region.Incidentally, Bundelkhand has had more per capita availability of food grains than the state average as observed between years 1997 and 2006 in the 2009 study on the region by AK Singh, A Joshi and Nomita P Kumar from the Giri Institute of Development Studies.Central Uttar Pradesh which includes important administrative and business districts such as Lucknow and Kanpur, though with the lowest average number of ration card holders per district in the state, has received maximum average number of applications per district.A large backlog of pending applications and the return of more than 30 lakh migrant workers is a worrying combination. Moreover, the pending applications also include those received before the current crisis. The introduction of new ration cards in the state in 2016 replacing the old ones had left many erstwhile ration card holders without one. These ration cards are also a prerequisite for availing benefits for many other schemes such as Ujjwala Gas Yojana (scheme).While the lockdown has spelled disaster for returning migrant workers, those eligible for ration cards who were already living here and have been hit hard by the suspension of economic activity also urgently need them.

The technology has been developed by CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology).\"The Tata CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) test, powered by CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology) FELUDA, received regulatory approvals today from DCGI for commercial launch, as per ICMR guidelines, meeting high quality benchmarks with 96 per cent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity for detecting novel coronavirus,\" the statement said.The Tata CRISPR test is the world's first diagnostic test to deploy a specially adapted Cas9 protein to successfully detect the virus causing COVID-19, it said.Moreover, CRISPR is a \"futuristic\" technology that can also be configured for detection of multiple other pathogens in the future.\"The Tata Group has worked closely with CSIR-IGIB and ICMR to create a high-quality test that will help the nation ramp up COVID-19 testing quickly and economically, with a 'Made in India' product that is safe, reliable, affordable and accessible,\" the statement added.Commenting on the development, Girish Krishnamurthy, CEO, TATA Medical and Diagnostics Ltd said, \"The approval for the Tata CRISPR test for COVID-19 will give a boost to the country's efforts in fighting the global pandemic.\"The commercialisation of Tata CRISPR test reflects the tremendous R&D talent in the country which can collaborate to transform India's contributions to the global healthcare and scientific research world,\" he said.Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-IGIB, said the work started by CSIR under the sickle cell mission for genome diagnostics and therapeutics led to new knowledge that could be harnessed to quickly develop new diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.He emphasised that this shows the interconnectedness of scientific knowledge and technology and the innovation of the young research team led by Debojyoti Chakraborty and Souvik Maiti.\n",
            "tensor(0.7826)  ===>  Farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are peeved at being blamed for Delhi’s smog. “We have been burning crop residue for the past 50 years now,” said a leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union from Haryana, who does not want to be named. “If anybody is affected, it should be the surrounding villages. We don’t face any such problem. So why is this problem in Delhi seen just during these past few years?”Every winter, not just Delhi but also large parts of north India are frequently enveloped in a thick blanket of smog, caused by air pollution from vehicular and industrial emissions mixing with fog. The burning of post-harvest paddy stubble in the agricultural fields of Haryana and Punjab is often cited as a major cause of this unhealthy smog.This year, health experts fear that the effects of COVID-19, which primarily causes respiratory problems, would be worsened by heightened air pollution due to smog and smoke from the annual stubble burning.According to a report by The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), last year, from October to December, air pollution in New Delhi and other cities in north India was up to 20 times higher than the safe threshold levels defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO).It is estimated that Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of rice stubble, 80 percent of which is burnt. According to the TERI report, due to labour shortages during COVID-19, paddy transplantation date was advanced to 10 June this year. However, this is unlikely to contain stubble burning. Why burnFarmers resort to burning of crop residue due to the short time window available to sow the next wheat crop. Traditionally, older farmers in Punjab and Haryana recall, very little paddy was sown as wheat, not rice, is the staple diet in the region. However, with the advent of the Green Revolution, a rice-wheat crop rotation has become the norm, under which specialised short-duration varieties were introduced.Rice is grown between June and October, followed by wheat from November to April. Any delay in sowing of wheat adversely affects crop yield. As farmers get barely 20-25 days between the two crops, the easiest way to clear the field is burning the crop residue instead of the more time-consuming mechanical route. Which is also quite expensive, say farmers.In 2013, under the Air Act, 1981, the Punjab government banned the burning of crop residue in the fields. Later, in 2015, the National Green Tribunal prohibited the burning of paddy straw while directing the government to help farmers manage the paddy straw using specialised equipment like Happy Seeder that chops paddy straw, sows wheat seeds and layers the straw as a mulch. Other machines like Rotavator, that bundle the straw into bales to be transported, were also to be procured and used.Punjab Agriculture department officials said about 20,000 pieces of farm equipment were supplied to Punjab farmers in 2019 under a centrally sponsored scheme to promote mechanisation. In the previous year, 28,000 machines were given out. Despite that, according to official data, Punjab witnessed over 22,000 incidents of stubble burning till November 2019.Machines of contentionAs a solution for the current year, the Punjab and Haryana governments submitted an Action Plan to a Supreme Court mandated panel to check stubble burning. The plan promises farmers easier accessibility to machinery that manages crop residue.But with just a few weeks to go before the fields are cleared post-harvest for the kharif, or winter, wheat sowing, there appears to be little momentum to implement this Action Plan. Especially as no systems are yet in place to enable farmers to hire machines at affordable rates.As things stand, it seems it will be business as usual, particularly with the state governments forced to use available personnel and resources in battling the pandemic.“The paddy crop is still standing which we will begin harvesting next month,” says Ekta Sukhdev Singh, a farmer in Kukarikalan village of Punjab. “We have to begin sowing wheat in December but as of now, no arrangements have been made for any stubble clearing machines”.Under the Action Plan, the two state governments are to set up more Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) to rent out machinery to farmers who cannot afford to buy the high-end machinery, besides supplying more balers—a machine used to compress stubble into compact bales.Punjab claims it has set up 7,378 CHCs over the past two years and has announced another 5,200 CHCs will be set up this year to meet the target of having one CHC in each village. Haryana has set up 2,879 CHCs and 2,000 more will be established by October, the government has said.CHCs are machine banks that rent out expensive machines to farmers, who cannot afford to buy them. The CHCs generally comprise cooperative societies, private entrepreneurs, informal farmers’ groups or FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations). The machines, which are rented out to farmers, are bought at a subsidised cost.The machines don’t come cheap. A Super Seeder costs Rs 2.1 lakh; Happy Seeder Rs 1.5-1.75 lakh; Rotavator Rs 1.15 lakh; Mulcher Rs 1.7 lakh; MB Plough Rs 2 lakh; and Baler Rs 14 to 20 lakh. But the CHCs get financial assistance of 80 per cent from the Centre.The Union government has also launched a multilingual mobile app, CHC Farm Machinery to help farmers hire machinery from CHCs located within 50 km radius of their farms.Where does the money go?The Centre launched a scheme, “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the State of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh & NCT of Delhi” with a total outgo of Rs 1151.80 crore for the period 2018-19 to 2019-20. During 2019-20, funds amounting to Rs 273.80 crore, Rs 192.06 crore and Rs 105.29 crore have also been released to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively.In its 2020-21 Budget announced on February 28th, Haryana government allocated Rs 454 crore for management of crop residue. Besides, last month, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal introduced a comprehensive Rs 1,304 crore plan for crop residue management. The Punjab government allocated Rs 20 crore for crop residue management for the fiscal 2020-21.The machines need an around 45 hp (horse power) tractor to operate, working at a rate of 0.25-0.35 hectares per hour. Their operating constrains include a lower machine capacity as compared to conventional seed drills and inability to operate in wet straw.For the small farmers, the cost of hiring the machine is steep. Moreover, there is no standardized rental rate. Farmers can end up paying anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000 per acre. For the farmers it makes more sense to pay a fine of Rs 2,500 on paddy burning than hire a machine.“Farmers are in favour of deploying the machines as burning stubble leads to a massive loss of natural productive elements, such as micro-organisms and useful worms and insects, which get burnt in the process,” says Sukhdev Singh, a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “Moreover, precious organic material also gets burnt”.Environmental scientists estimate that for every acre of land where paddy straw is burnt, there is a loss of 5.5 kg ofnitrogen, 2.3 kg phosphates, 25 kg potassium and about two tonnes of manure. As for emissions, about three tons of carbon dioxide, 120 kg of carbon monoxide, six kg of particulate matter, four kg of sulphur dioxide, and 400 kg of ash are released per acre.“Systems should also be in place to sell the straw or stubble, which can be used in a variety of ways, from electricity generation and manure to manufacture of furniture, bedding material, flooring and tiles,” added Sukhdev Singh. “A farmer cannot be expected to go about selling the stubble. Mechanisms that make economic sense for farmers and factories would be win-win for all”.Operational challengesVarious experts have recommended a holistic approach to tackle this problem. While mechanised management of crop residue is needed, it should make economic sense.“We should stop blaming the farmers, instead we should propose methods that are economically and ecologically desirable,” said eminent agricultural scientist Dr MS Swaminathan in an e-mail response. “Since the organic matter content of our soils is low, I have recommended that the rice straw, which is being burnt in Punjab and Haryana, should be incorporated in the soil to improve both soil physics and moisture holding capacity”.CHC as a concept is not new, says Chandrakant Pradhan, Lead-Climate Change Resilience, CII Foundation. Over the last two years, Punjab has been setting them up through cooperative societies, which are encouraged to buy machines at a subsidized cost and rent them out to farmers. Entrepreneurs, informal farmers’ groups and FPOs (Farmer Producer Organisations) are also eligible to set up CHCs.Haryana is promoting CHCs mostly through entrepreneurs or through informal groups of farmers. “Success of the scheme this season, however, will primarily depend on how effectively demand for large scale use of machines is created,” Pradhan said.According to ICAR, Punjab is likely to see paddy cultivation in around 27 lakh hectares (ha) this season. This is down from 31 lakh ha last year. The state average productivity is about 3.9 tonnes/ha. Around 200 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated per year.Haryana has about 13 lakh ha under rice cultivation. The state’s average productivity is about 3.1 tonnes/ha. Around 12 lakh tonnes of paddy straw is generated every year in the state.The operational challenges vary depending upon the ownership structure. Sukhdev Singh said big farmers hire most of the machines. “Farmers with 2-4 acre land holdings are left out,” he said.Corroborating this, Pradhan said private CHCs tend to associate mostly with farmers with large land holdings, who have the resources to pay the hiring charges. Such farmers come together to form CHCs and once they get the subsidy benefit on the machines they keep the machines for their own use and do not rent them out to others, which defeats the whole purpose of the CHC.“It is not yet clear whether the CHC is a viable business model in the long run,” adds Pradhan. “The capital cost requirement is significant even after subsidy. Considering that O&M (operation and maintenance) cost is also high, it remains to be seen how the business model play out in the long run”. Cost deterrentQuality and after sales services are the other sticky issues. But the main deterrent is the high cost of the machines, even with the subsidy. “Typically, a cooperative would require 6-10 machines, for which they need to pay about Rs 5-6 lakh after subsidy,” says Pradhan.“We have been giving a subsidy of 50 percent to individual farmers and 80 percent to cooperative societies for buying farm machines,” an official said. The National Green Tribunal order had directed the government to supply machinery free of cost to farmers owning less than two acres of land.However, farmers are demanding a bonus of around Rs 200 per quintal or Rs 3,000 per acre while procuring paddy, as incentive to those who do not burn stubble. Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had last year written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a compensation of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy as incentive.“Our demand is Rs 5,000 per acre,” said Sukhdev Singh, adding that last year’s compensation had not yet been given. The way forward“We always adopt the ‘don’t’ philosophy and not the ‘do’ philosophy, which I have been advocating for a long time,” said Dr MS Swaminathan. Farmers would like to remove the rice stubble on time for sowing wheat. One way, Swaminathan points out, is the environmentally destructive method of burning the straw in the field leading to smog. The other is to find economic use of the straw.“While Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh are rich in rice straw, it is not used as animal fodder, while states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka lack enough animal feed. It will be ideal if the fodder deficient states tie up with Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. It could be a win-win situation both for the farmers and for the environment,” he said.“Providing machinery is just one part of the solution,” adds Pradhan. “Farmers also need training to run these machines to get optimum results. Lack of such training discourages farmers from using these machines as they don’t get desired results.”All of this means Delhi is unlikely to get any relief from burning, smoke and smog this year too.This article was first published in Citizen Matters, a civic media website and is republished here with permission.
